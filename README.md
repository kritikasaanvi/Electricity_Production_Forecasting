# Electricity Production Forecasting

## Overview
Electricity production forecasting plays a crucial role in energy management, grid stability, and sustainable power distribution. This project aims to analyze historical electricity production data and predict future trends using advanced machine learning and deep learning models. By leveraging time-series forecasting techniques, we can provide insights into energy generation patterns, identify seasonal variations, and optimize power generation strategies. The study primarily focuses on forecasting electricity production for the next 30 days, with potential applications in demand planning, renewable energy integration, and smart grid optimization. The dataset includes hourly electricity production data from Romania and Turkey, allowing for a comparative analysis of different energy sources.
